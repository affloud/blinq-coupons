Blinq is a digital business card app that lets you create your own personalized card online. Instead of carrying paper cards, you can share your information with others instantly using QR codes, NFC (tap your phone), or a simple link. This way, people can save your contact details right on their phone without typing anything.

The app also helps you keep track of the people you meet by saving their info automatically. It connects with popular tools like Salesforce and HubSpot, so you can manage your contacts easily.

What makes Blinq different is how simple it is to use and how many ways you can share your card. It also gives you data on how many times your card was seen or shared, helping you know if your networking is working.
